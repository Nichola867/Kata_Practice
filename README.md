# Kata Practice
Codewars is a community of developers (know as 'Code Warriors'), that train on improving their development skills. Think of it like a coding dojo - where developers train with each other and help each other get better through practice.

### Kata
Kata are code challenges focused on improving skill and technique. They are the main activity performed on the site. Some of these challenges train programming fundamentals, while others focus on complex problem solving. Others are puzzles meant to test your creative problem solving, while others are based on real world coding scenarios.

Each kata is crafted for and by the community. The author (or Sensei) who created kata will initially include one or more languages to train in. Other Code Warriors later can "translate" the kata into additional languages.


### Instructions

[CodeWars.com](https://www.codewars.com/) provides kata questions to be resolved. Challenges I have completed (using Javascript) have been included here, along with self-written tests.
